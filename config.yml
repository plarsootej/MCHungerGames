#        Conditions - Rules only apply when these conditions are met
#        Show warning to players - when they try to build/break and are denied
#    GameMakers - removed, but it meant that gamemakers could edit arenas when this is true
#               - now this is, by default, true
#    ArenaOptions - These are misc. options for how things are handled with arenas
#      Countdown message - message to display when the countdown is incremented
#                        - <count> is replaced with the current number the coutndown is on

#        disqualify - This will remove <player> as a tribute when they disconnect when they're in a game
#    Nearby chat - this is going to be like the RealisticChat plugin
#        - This certainly doesn't work with EssentialsChat and HeroChat. 
#        - I'm currently fixing this, but for now you if you have one of these plugins, just disable this feature
#        Distances
#          - Clear - this means they can see the message and sender just fine
#          - Disembodied - they can see the message, but not very clearly who sent it
#          - Garbled - both the message and player name are obscured and hard to read
